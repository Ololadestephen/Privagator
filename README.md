# 🔐 Privagator — Zama FHE Builder Track Project

**Privagator** is a privacy-preserving data explorer built using **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology.  
It allows users to perform computations on encrypted data — keeping sensitive information secure **even during processing**.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Zama FHE Builder Track**, demonstrating practical FHE applications with a working web interface.

### 🔐 Core Features
- **Secure Multiplication** - Multiply encrypted values
- **Encrypted Addition** - Add numbers privately  
- **Private Comparisons** - Compare values without revealing them
- **Aggregate Analytics** - Compute totals and averages on encrypted data
- **Interactive Web Interface** - User-friendly FHE experience

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Zama Concrete Framework** (simulated operations for demo)
- **Streamlit** — Interactive web frontend
- **Flask** — Backend server (for local FHE operations)
- **Git + Virtualenv**

---

#  🧠 FHE Operations Implemented
✅ Secure Multiplication - a × b on encrypted values
✅ Encrypted Addition - x + y without decryption
✅ Square Function - x² computed privately
✅ Private Comparison - a > b without revealing values
✅ Aggregate Analytics - Sum and average of encrypted datasets

#  🎓 Builder Track Highlights
This project demonstrates:

Practical FHE Applications - Real-world use cases for encrypted computation
