# 🧠 Privagator — Zama FHE Builder Track Project

**Privagator** is a privacy-preserving data explorer built using **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology.  
It allows users to perform computations on encrypted data — keeping sensitive information secure **even during processing**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Zama FHE Builder Track**, leveraging Zama’s `Concrete` and `TFHE` libraries to explore privacy-first computation.

### 🔐 Core Idea
Perform private data analysis and machine learning inference **without revealing the underlying data**.

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- 🐍 **Python 3.10+**
- 🧮 **Zama Concrete Library**
- 🌐 **Streamlit** — interactive frontend
- 🔥 **PyTorch** — optional ML integration
- ⚙️ **Git + Virtualenv**

---
